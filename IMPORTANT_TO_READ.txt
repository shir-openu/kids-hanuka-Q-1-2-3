⚠️  THE CRITICAL PROBLEM - INACCURATE FIGURES (HIGH IMPORTANCE!)
================================================================================

PROBLEM:
--------
When Claude Code tried to CREATE geometric figures from scratch using SVG code,
the results were NOT ACCURATE. The angles, proportions, and positions were
approximations that DID NOT MATCH the original homework drawings.

THIS IS CRITICAL FOR KIDS because:
- Misleading diagrams confuse children
- Wrong visual representation leads to wrong understanding
- Geometry requires EXACT figures to learn correctly

WHAT WENT WRONG (v1, v2):
-------------------------
Claude attempted to manually write SVG coordinates like:

    <line x1="400" y1="45" x2="40" y2="200"/>  <!-- guessed coordinates -->
    <path d="M 400 45 L 360 85 A 45 45 0 0 0 375 90 Z"/>  <!-- approximated arc -->

Problems with this approach:
1. Claude cannot "see" geometry - only generates code
2. Angle calculations were mathematical approximations
3. Triangle proportions didn't match the original PDF
4. Kids would see DIFFERENT figures than in their homework!

================================================================================
✅  THE SOLUTION - USE EXACT SVG FILES (HIGH IMPORTANCE!)
================================================================================

SOLUTION:
---------
Instead of Claude creating figures, we used the EXACT SVG files exported from
the original PDF:

    q1_drawing.svg  (exact figure for question 1)
    q2_drawing.svg  (exact figure for question 2)
    q3_drawing.svg  (exact figure for question 3)

These SVG files contain the PRECISE geometry from the teacher's homework.

HOW TO EMBED EXACT SVG FILES IN HTML:
-------------------------------------
WRONG (v1, v2 - manual SVG code):

    <svg width="450" height="280">
      <line x1="400" y1="45" x2="40" y2="200"/>  <!-- INACCURATE! -->
      ...manually written coordinates...
    </svg>

CORRECT (v4 - reference external SVG file):

    <img src="q1_drawing.svg" alt="שרטוט שאלה 1">

This way, the HTML simply DISPLAYS the exact original figure without
any modification or approximation.

================================================================================
⚠️  GITHUB PAGES ISSUE - FILE PATHS (HIGH IMPORTANCE!)
================================================================================

PROBLEM WITH v3:
----------------
In v3, we referenced SVG files from parent folder:

    <img src="../q1_drawing.svg">  <!-- DOESN'T WORK ON GITHUB! -->

This worked locally but FAILED on GitHub Pages because the path "../"
pointed outside the repository.

SOLUTION IN v4:
---------------
Put ALL files in the SAME folder and use simple filename:

    <img src="q1_drawing.svg">  <!-- WORKS ON GITHUB! -->

CORRECT FILE STRUCTURE:
-----------------------
    kids-hanuka-Q-1-2-3/
    ├── index.html          (references SVGs in same folder)
    ├── q1_drawing.svg      (exact drawing)
    ├── q2_drawing.svg      (exact drawing)
    └── q3_drawing.svg      (exact drawing)

📋  VERSION HISTORY - LEARNING FROM MISTAKES
================================================================================

VERSION 1 (FAILED):
- Claude manually wrote SVG coordinates
- Figures were inaccurate approximations
- Angles didn't look right

VERSION 2 (FAILED):
- Still manual SVG code
- Added hints system (good)
- Figures still wrong (bad)

VERSION 3 (PARTIALLY FAILED):
- Used exact SVG files (good!)
- Path "../q1_drawing.svg" didn't work on GitHub (bad)
- Worked locally, failed online

VERSION 4 (SUCCESS):
- Used exact SVG files (good!)
- Path "q1_drawing.svg" in same folder (good!)
- Works both locally AND on GitHub Pages (good!)

================================================================================
🎯  KEY TAKEAWAY FOR FUTURE PROJECTS
================================================================================

RULE: Never let AI generate geometric figures from scratch for educational
      materials. AI cannot visually verify accuracy.

INSTEAD:
1. Export exact figures from original source (PDF, image, etc.) as SVG
2. Reference the SVG files in HTML using <img src="filename.svg">
3. Keep all files in the same folder for web deployment
4. Test on actual hosting platform (GitHub Pages) not just locally
